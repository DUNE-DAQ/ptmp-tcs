THESE ARE THE Runs and Events from the 10500 sample which have an unequal number of candidates for the two thresholds, and a classification for why:

APA NUMBERING WITHIN IS FOR THE FELIX INSTRUMENTED AND DOES NOT MATCH THE LArSodt (LAR 1 = 0, LAR 3 = 1, LAR 5 = 2)
NEED CHECK THE SORTING OF CANDIDATES...

Run: 24 Event: 22
Candidates for fh15: 3
Candidates for fh18: 4
Reason for discrepancy: Window 24 in APA 0 for fh15 had adjacency 37, whereas for fh18 it had adjacency 67
OTHER NOTES: None

Run: 24 Event: 58
Candidates for fh15: 7
Candidates for fh18: 6
Reason for discrepancy: Window 17 in APA 1 doesn't show up anywhere for fh18 but had adjacency 244 for fh15...
OTHER NOTES: This will fail the module trigger for quite an odd reason that has to do with knockout or something it would seem... may be fixed by gaps corrections...

Run: 24 Event: 109
Candidates for fh15: 2
Candidates for fh18: 1
Reason for discrepancy: Window 28 in APA 1 doesn't show up anywhere for fh18 but had adjacency 293 for fh15...
OTHER NOTES: Another Lost Window... That's the real concern...

Run: 24 Event: 177
Candidates for fh15: 13
Candidates for fh18: 14
Reason for discrepancy: Window 15 in APA 0 for fh15 had adjacency 46, whereas for fh18 it had adjacency 60
OTHER NOTES: None

Run: 35 Event: 183
Candidates for fh15: 3

Candidates for fh18: 3
Reason for discrepancy: Window 20 in APA 1 doesn't show up anywhere for fh18 but had adjacency 230 for fh15...
OTHER NOTES: This will fail the module trigger for quite an odd reason that has to do with knockout or something it would seem... may be fixed by gaps corrections...
